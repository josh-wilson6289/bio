# Josh Wilson Bio

This is a portfolio site created using the Bootstrap framework.  Each page has a navbar, footer, and a responsive layout.  This portfolio site is a starting point and will be added to as the class progresses.  For the time being, I've linked four projects.  There is also a contact page that I will later refine, since I don't want my email to be scraped from the page.
